# report-builder

### Project Description:
Create a `result.html` page for our web application where users can generate structured radiological reports (`laudos`). The page should be optimized for performance and user experience, allowing users to select sentences from previously generated radiological reports by clicking and dragging, similar to motion design tools. Users should be able to print the final report seamlessly. Ensure the design is responsive and adheres to our existing UI/UX guidelines.

### Technical Specifications:
1. **Framework**: Utilize the latest version of Tailwind CSS for styling and Alpine.js for interactivity.
2. **Data Integration**: Fetch previously generated radiological reports (`laudos`) from the backend and display them in a draggable, selectable format. Use the following database variables:
    - `user_id`: The ID of the user.
    - `report_id`: The ID of the report.
    - `report_content`: The content of the previously generated report.
    - `created_at`: The date and time when the report was created.
3. **User Interaction**: Implement a click-and-drag functionality for users to select sentences from previous reports and add them to the current report.
4. **Report Generation**: Provide an interface to compile the selected sentences into a structured final report. Include options to edit, finalize, and print the report.
5. **Performance**: Ensure the page loads quickly and interactions are smooth. Optimize all assets and minimize the use of heavy libraries.
6. **UI/UX Consistency**: Follow the existing color scheme and design language used in our application. Use CSS variables for color management:
    - `--primary-color: #1E1E1C`
    - `--secondary-color: #C7EAF3`
    - `--highlight-color: #216D77`
    - `--dark-bg-color: #242421`
    - `--light-bg-color: #FCFDF9`
    - `--light-nav-color: #ECEDE6`
    - `--border-color: #444444`
    - `--input-bg-color: #333333`
7. **Professional UI/UX**: Utilize modern, professional UI/UX components from React libraries such as Magic UI to ensure the interface is clean, intuitive, and not childish. Ensure all elements have a polished and professional look.
8. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the page is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
9. **Accessibility**: Ensure the page is accessible, adhering to WCAG guidelines.
